# Designing Machine Learning Systems at Scale

A hopefully really long list of resources in the form of blog posts, podcasts, youtube videos etc where engineers talk and write about the machine learning systems they've built and scaled. 

Please feel free to add resources for machine learning system design that you've been using to this list! Thanks!
